## About
This repo is a collection of static HTML pages and CSS styles that demonstrate UI experiments, layouts, and small front-end projects. It’s primarily used for practicing HTML structure and CSS design.

## Purpose & goals
- Practice semantic HTML
- Explore modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Build small UI components (cards, forms, navbars)
- Learn responsive design principles

## Live preview / opening files
To view any project:
1. Open the project's `index.html` in a browser.
2. Or use a local server for a better experience:
   - VS Code Live Server
   - python -m http.server
   - npm http-server

## Folder structure (recommended)
- /project-1/
  - index.html
  - css/
  - assets/
- /project-2/
- /shared-css/ (optional)
Make sure each project contains an `index.html` and a short `README.md` describing purpose and how to preview it.

## Best practices & style guide
- Use semantic tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer
- Keep CSS modular and avoid global overrides
- Use classes for styling; avoid over-reliance on IDs
- Use responsive units (%, rem, em) and media queries for breakpoints

## How to contribute
- Create a new folder for your experiment
- Add `index.html`, CSS, and assets
- Include a small README explaining the concept and how to view it
- Open a PR with screenshots
